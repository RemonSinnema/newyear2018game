= New Year Game API

The Game Server hosts a REST API. We will walk through a couple of scenarios that demonstrate how a client can use
the API to play games. 


== Add Players

In order to be able to play a game, we need players. Let's add one now.

Start at the _billboard URL_ `/`:
include::{snippets}/add-player/1/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/1/http-response.adoc[]

Follow the `players` link relation to access the game's players:
include::{snippets}/add-player/2/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/2/http-response.adoc[]

The list is initially empty. Issue a `POST` request to add a player:
include::{snippets}/add-player/3/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/3/http-response.adoc[]
Note that a representation of the added player is returned, but also the `Location` header contains its URI.

To verify that the player is indeed added, retry the `GET` request for the players:
include::{snippets}/add-player/4/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/4/http-response.adoc[]
