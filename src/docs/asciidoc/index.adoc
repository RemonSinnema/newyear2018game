= Game API
:toc:

The Game Server hosts a REST API. We will walk through a couple of scenarios that demonstrate how a client can use
the API to play games. 



== Add Players

In order to be able to play a game, we need players. Here's how to do that.

Start at the _billboard URL_ `/`:
include::{snippets}/add-player/1/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/1/http-response.adoc[]

Follow the `players` link relation to access the game's players:
include::{snippets}/add-player/2/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/2/http-response.adoc[]

The list is initially empty. Issue a `POST` request to add a player:
include::{snippets}/add-player/3/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/3/http-response.adoc[]
A representation of the newly added player is returned, and the `Location` header contains its URI. The same
representation can be retrieved from a `GET` request to that URI:
include::{snippets}/add-player/4/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/4/http-response.adoc[]

And the player is now available from the list:
include::{snippets}/add-player/5/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/5/http-response.adoc[]

It depends on the game being played how many players are required/allowed. For instance, tic-tac-toe is played with
two players. So adding a second player is fine:
include::{snippets}/add-player/6/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/6/http-response.adoc[]

But adding a third will fail:
include::{snippets}/add-player/7/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-player/7/http-response.adoc[]


== Start the game
 
As soon as the minimum number of players are added to the game, it can be started. This is indicated by the
presence of the `start` link relation:
include::{snippets}/play-game/1/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/1/http-response.adoc[]

To start the game, issue a `POST` request to the corresponding URI:
include::{snippets}/play-game/2/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/2/http-response.adoc[]

The response contains the current `level` of the game and a link to the current player via the
`current-player` link relation. One of the added players is selected at random the have the first turn.

To actually start playing the game, the current player can now select one of the moves accessible via the `moves` 
link relation.
