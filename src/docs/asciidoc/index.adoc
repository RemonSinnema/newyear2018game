= Game API
:toc:

The Game Server hosts a REST API. We will walk through a couple of scenarios that demonstrate how a client can use
the API to play games. 



== Add Players

In order to be able to play a game, we need players. Here's how to do that.

Start at the _billboard URL_ `/`:
include::{snippets}/play-game/1/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/1/http-response.adoc[]

Follow the `players` link relation to access the game's players:
include::{snippets}/play-game/2/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/2/http-response.adoc[]

The list is initially empty. Issue a `POST` request to add a player:
include::{snippets}/play-game/3/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/3/http-response.adoc[]
A representation of the newly added player is returned, and the `Location` header contains its URI. The same
representation can be retrieved from a `GET` request to that URI:
include::{snippets}/play-game/4/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/4/http-response.adoc[]

And the player is now available from the list:
include::{snippets}/play-game/5/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/5/http-response.adoc[]

It depends on the game being played how many players are required/allowed. For instance, tic-tac-toe is played with
two players. So adding a second player is fine:
include::{snippets}/play-game/6/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/6/http-response.adoc[]

But adding a third will fail:
include::{snippets}/play-game/7/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/7/http-response.adoc[]


== Start the game
 
As soon as the minimum number of players are added to the game, it can be started. This is indicated by the
presence of the `start` link relation:
include::{snippets}/play-game/8/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/8/http-response.adoc[]

To start the game, issue a `POST` request to the corresponding URI:
include::{snippets}/play-game/9/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/9/http-response.adoc[]

The response contains the current `level` of the game and a link to the current player via the
`current-player` link relation. One of the added players is selected at random the have the first turn.

The current world of the game is available via the `world` link relation:
include::{snippets}/play-game/10/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/10/http-response.adoc[]

The actual content type of the response depends on how the game's world is rendered. The response could be HTML, an
image, or anything else, really. Some games may even render the world as a structure in, say, HAL, leaving the client
to do the rendering.


== Make a move

To actually start playing the game, retrieve the possible moves via the `moves` link relation:
include::{snippets}/play-game/12/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/12/http-response.adoc[]

Then select a move from the list and `POST` to its URI:
include::{snippets}/play-game/13/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/play-game/13/http-response.adoc[]

This points us back to the game, where the client can find the new rendering of the world, the new current player, the
new available moves, etc.
