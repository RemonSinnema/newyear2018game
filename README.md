# New Year's Eve 2018

This is a simple game for keeping us busy at New Year's Eve 2018.


# Players

- 9-10 players
- ages 10-75
- 5-6 male, 4 female
- varying computer skills


# Objective

- Keep us occupied for about 4 hours
- Have fun


# Initialization

- All players must choose their avatar (from long list, or from short list followed by variations)
- Alternatively, each player answers a couple of questions and the game will assign them an avatar based on their answers
- Or we could just take a photo of the player


# Game play

- To keep it interesting, split the game up into different levels that take about an hour or so each to complete
- Investigate whether it's feasible to have group or even individual levels, e.g #1 global level, #2 group level, #3 individual level, #4 global level
- The final level should be able to shrink/expand as needed to fill the time

## Winning

While this game is more about having fun than winning, having some element of competition adds to the fun. Conceivable ways to win:
- Each player collect credits of some kind; the player with the most credits at the end wins
- Each player races towards a finish line of some kind; the first player wins
- Some combination where finishing earlier gets you more credits, but where finishing first doesn't automatically wins


# Delivery mode

- Play on big screen TV (using Google cast)
- Control using tablet or mobile phone
- Table remains available for drinks & food


# Post-Game

- After the game is over, create a short video/animated gif for each of the players' journeys through the game
