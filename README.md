# Game play


## Levels

To keep it interesting, split the game up into different levels that take about an hour or so each to complete
- Investigate whether it's feasible to have group or even individual levels, e.g #1 global level, #2 group level, #3 individual level, #4 global level
- Each level should be able to shrink/expand as needed to fill the alotted time

Potential levels:
- city, including a park and a supermarket where you can find groceries you'll need later (e.g. ingredients for donuts)
- maze
- forest, with lake, beach, cave, mountains

## Winning

While this game is more about having fun than winning, having some element of competition adds to the fun.
So, each player collect New Year's resolutions and the player with the most resolutions at the end wins.
But a player can also collect other things that can help them:
- food (donut/apple fritter): over time a player grows hungry and moves slower, unless they eat something
- firecrackers: ward of enemies or blow up roadblocks
- fireworks: light the way in the dark
- special honor: one person can collect this and gets to do something special after the game (e.g. pick the name of the lottery winner)


# Delivery mode

- Play on big screen TV (using Google cast)
- Control using tablet or mobile phone
- Table remains available for drinks & food


# Post-Game

- After the game is over, create a short video/animated gif for each of the players' journeys through the game
